The prototype app for Commercial Development App

This is the javascript used in a Titanium Appcelerator IDE.
More info on Appcelerator here: http://www.appcelerator.com/

The purpose of this app:
When out in our Town we often see something being built and wonder what it might be.  Or we might see a "PUBLIC NOTICE"
sign on the side of the road and wonder what is happening here.

Opening up this app, it uses the phone's location (GPS or Network) to determine the user's current position.
Then, it opens a map centered on this location.  The map is pre-populated with data regarding construction projects
in the Town of Cary.  If the user taps/clicks on a location (they are color-coded by month), the result is a popup
that has the name of the project and a hyperlink to the siteplan data on the Town of Cary website.
Generally, the name of the project provides enough basic information to determine what is being built, and the link
to the site plans has the details of what is going on the site.

App is functional but lacks any ability to annotate the map. Tested and functioning on a Nexus 4 android device.
Also tested on the iOS Apple simulator.

I've started a 'waffle' here to see if I can track issues/progress:
